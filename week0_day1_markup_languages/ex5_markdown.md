1. My programming background consists of **Codecademy**, **Udacity**, and **Udemy** courses. From Codecademy, I learned basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Then, I took Udacity to understand basic programming (Python). Udemy courses were for fun. I took it to develop games using C# and Unity.

2. I think everyone should learn how to code or at least understand how it functions. World is growing at fast pace and everything is digitalized nowadays. Coding is the language of computers, so people should familiarize themselves with coding (like learning English). On top of that, I think coding is fun in general. You get to create a masterpiece from scratch. I come from scientific field, but even in science, inventing has many restrictions.

3. Through *Hack Reactor Prep*, I would like to prepare myself for Hack Reactor and ultimately become better software engineer.
