Over the course of this class, you are going to build the Internet's premier watering hole for a very specific community. Examples include: Foodies in Topeka, Russian-speaking fantasy football enthusiasts, and alpaca-fur-loving fashionitas.

Take a moment to think of a couple of ideas. They can be funny or serious or anything else. No rules.
Close your eyes and envision your ideal community members in as much detail as possible. How will they want to interact with your site? Are you excited to invest time in helping these people?
Collect feedback about your ideas from some of your classmates. Also take some time to get to know them a little.
Give them your feedback on their ideas.
Decide on your final idea and prepare a 30-second elevator pitch to present it to the class.
Create a one page "pitch sheet" using Markdown to hand out to investors. Include some charts and graphs as well as inspirational stock photography. -->
